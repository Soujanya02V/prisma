This project demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Prisma ORM with a MySQL database in a Node.js environment. The script connects to a MySQL database using the Prisma Client and carries out operations such as creating a single user (`create`), inserting multiple users (`createMany`), retrieving all users (`findMany`), fetching a user by unique ID (`findUnique`), updating a user's data (`update`), and deleting a user by ID (`delete`). It highlights important Prisma practices like avoiding the use of unique fields with `updateMany`, and ensures proper disconnection from the database using `prisma.$disconnect()` in the `finally` block. To run the project, you must configure the MySQL connection in the `schema.prisma` file, install the dependencies, generate the Prisma client, and optionally run migrations. This script serves as a simple and effective example for understanding how to work with relational databases using Prisma in full-stack or backend applications.
